# Analysis_of_land_surface_temp_over_India
The project is all about the Analysis of patterns of temperature due to drastic change in atmospheric temperature this year compared
from 2002 to 2021 land data using Modis data. For understanding comparison, we use a probability distribution,
to check the trend of temp variation in the past year compared to this year.
